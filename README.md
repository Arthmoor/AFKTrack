# AFKTrack
A simple bug tracking package designed to be easy to use, yet detailed enough for keeping track of bugs and other issues with software.
It has been designed with mod authors in mind to be able to manage multiple projects and categories as well as group development.

Includes the following features:

* Multiple projects with categories that can be specific to each.
* Full user profile support including avatars.
* Ability to retire a project or a category within a proejct in the event further issues will not be accepted for them.
* Full theme support using the XTemplate theme package.
* Akismet support for robust spam filtering of both user registrations and issue submissions.
* Issue posting uses BBCode formatting. Cause we're just that dinosaur about it.
